in the file called "barcode_reader_function.py" on the 12th line change the "rtsp_url = 1" if you want to use the main camera on your pc, or phone. if you want to use an ip camera from your phone add it this way "http://ip:port/video"

this is an application for people to use, in stores and at home to search up products or create a cart of products, and see in which store is the cheapest.

i do not allow anyone to use this. Or make changes to it.
